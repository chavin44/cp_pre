in this file you can find my sublime text keymapping essentially if you hold alt + wasd
you move in that direction for example alt+w means cursor goes up without using ur mouse
same goes for the rest of the keys (wasd), I made this so I can move fast even in sublime text
until i learn vim motions and switch to neovim (im sry the primagen, ik ur upset in me)
